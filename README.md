# Manual

## So, always the perfect mount in any given situation!

If you are lucky and got a few mounts in your collection, then it's quite simple to name the right mount to summon in every situation. Depending on the actual circumstances you are in.

__Mounty #TLV__ offers __7 categories__ for your mounts:

- __Ground mounts__ - Mounts, which are big fun to ride, always with their feet on the ground.
- __Flying mounts__ - These can spread their wings or ignite their rockets to reach for the sky, with you on their back.
- __Dragonflight__ - Two wings, spitting fire, dead eyes and faster than the devil. Ride the dragons!
- __Water mounts__ - There are/were mounts which could walk on the water. At least there are few which are faster swimmers than others, so you don't have to hold your breath too long.
- __Repair mounts__ - You got one of these, haven't you? Or do you still have to run miles to the next anvil, to get bat to 100% durability?
- __Taxi mounts__ - A passenger's seat for a good friend is perfect for questing, farming, and fighting together hand in hand. Especially when your taxi has wings, and your friend doesn't know how to fly. He'll never forget your helping wing erm hand.
- __Show off mounts__ - You spent hours, days, weeks to get this special one, the mount of your dreams. There will never be a better one. Until tomorrow. But for now, everybody around must see: You got it!

You can assign up to __110 different favourite mounts to every category__ per drag & drop from your mount collection.

And you can assign this __one and only magic key__, which does its magic when pressed.

### 3 more, just for you

Since v2.5.2 you can use __3 additional custom categories__. Those don't play any part in the magic of __Mounty #TLV__, but you can summon them via key bindings. Your very special mounts for these very special moments.

## The magic that happens

There is a well defined logic behind the _magic_ of __Mounty #TLV__ and you can even customize it with some options (see _Options_ below).

### Here we go!

In the end its quite simple. When the __magic key is pressed__, it goes like this:

__Are you already on a mount?__

Then __dismount__ and get down unless you're flying high and might fall at Hogger's feet. Then do nothing.

But beware: If _parachute mode_ ist enabled, __Mounty #TLV__ will dismount you at any height and it's up to you to make __a proper touch down__.

__You have not mounted yet?__

Then let's do _the real magic_ and get you __the mount you crave__ for.

You just killed thousands of enemies and your durability is lower than the threshold via options? Summon your __repair mount__ and be reborn.

You're soaking wet, swimming and surrounded by endless water? If _amphibian mode_ is active, your __water mount__ will appear every second summoning! 

You hang around with friends and your _taxi mode_ is on? My friend, we call for a __taxi mount__ to ride away together. Hop on!

You are in a resting area and _show off mode_ is activated? Time to impress everyone around with one of your favourite __show off mounts__.

You're in a flight zone, all alone? Spread your wings, wake the dragon or start your engines and up, up, up it goes with your favourite __Dragonflight mount__ or __fly mount__.

You're in a flight zone with friends but didn't activate _together mode_? Jump on your __fly mount__ or __Dragonflight mount__ and race the skies with your friends.

It is sad that you can't fly, and it gets worse, cause you're floating in cold water, but at least now you will summon your __water mount__ to get back to the beach asap.

None of the above did come true: Now it's time to get back to where it all started by climbing on the back of these good old __ground mounts__ and take your ride to all five horizons.

Magic done. By __Mounty #TLV__.

### The full magic in less words

>__Magic key is pressed, so now ...__\
>\
>__You are on a mount ...__\
>... and not flying -> _Dismount_\
>... and flying, with parachute enabled -> _Dismount_\
>... and flying -> _Do nothing_\
>\
>__You have not mounted ...__\
>Your durability is lower than xx% (see options) -> _Repair mount_\
>You are swimming, _Amphibia mode_ is on -> (every second time) _Water mount_\
>You are a party member, _taxi mode_ is on -> _Taxi mount_\
>You are in a resting area, _show off mode_ is active -> _Show off mount_\
>You are in a flight zone, all alone -> _Dragon_ or _Fly mount_\
>You are in a flight zone with friends and _together mode_ is off -> _Dragon_ or _Fly mount_\
>You are swimming -> _Water mount_\
>else -> _Ground mount_

### But there is still more than that

__Mounty #TLV__ will choose the perfect category as described above. But there might be empty categories you didn't or couldn't assign any mount to.

In this case there is a _fallback_:

If a category is empty, it will then select one of your __flying mounts__. And if there are none, too, it will select one of your __ground mounts__. And if those are also missing, then there is only one last thing __Mounty #TLV__ can do for you: Randomly summon __any mount out of your whole collection__, preferring your favourites if there are any.

### Exceptions

- Exception 1: Dragonflight mounts will be used instead of flying mounts if Dragonflight mode is activated in options.
- Exception 2: As long as you haven't given to fly yet, ground mounts will always be prefered before dragons and fly mounts.
- Exception 3: In flyable resting areas only flyable show off mounts will be chosen.
- Exception 4: In flyable areas only flyable taxi mounts will be chosen.

### And why was a certain mount chosen?

The magic is kind of complex but it is transparent too.

__Mounty #TLV__ will keep a history of it's last 10 summonings and you can take it look at it anytime.

Type _/mounty why_ to see the newest (= last) entry.
Type _/mounty why 2-10_ to see an older entry.
Type _/mounty why all_ to see all entries.

You can also switch on _Why mode_ to show the explanation automatically in the chat window after each summoning. (See: _Options_)

# How to configure and use

Type __/mounty in the chat__ and the options frame will open.

__Mounty #TLV__'s option frame will also open __automatically with the mount journal__ if option is not deactivated.

And __Mounty #TLV__'s option frame can be opened __by clicking a button__ in the mount journal's bottom right corner.

__Drag & drop__ all your favourite mounts into the categories of your choice. Click right on a mount to remove it from a category.

You may __copy__ an already assigned mount to another category by __double clicking__.

Using the __plus button__ you can open another frame to assign __additional 100 mounts__ to a category. Here you can also easily __transfer all filtered mounts from the mount journal__ into a category with 1 click, erm 2 clicks.

__WARNING:__ __Mounty #TLV__ __does never check__ if your assignments per category make any sense! You can assign any mount to every category. So: Please be reasonable!

And __Mounty #TLV__ will only summon mounts of a chosen category that can be used at that moment - regarding faction, class, or else.

## Options

### Per profile

- __Why mode__ - Every time after _magically_ summoning a mount __Mounty #TLV__ will tell you exactly, why the resulting mount has been chosen.
- __Random mode__ - If _on_, __Mounty #TLV__ will randomly summon a mount of the selected _category_. If _off_ then it will cycle through one by one.
- __Show off mode__ - In resting areas everybody should see one of your show off mounts. Because everybody must know, that you went fishing in Zereth Mortis for hundreds of hours, just to get this one and only jelly fish.
- __Amphibian mode__ - Whilst swimming, alternate between water and flying mounts, because you might want to dive or you might want to fly away. Who knows?
- __Together mode__ - Whilst you are in a party: Even if you are in a flight zone and have learned to fly, you won't take off but stay on the ground. Looking for any reason? If you're questing or farming with a friend who can't fly yet, then it's quite fair to stay with him and keep eye level. Except ...
- __Taxi mode__ - You want to help a friend and give him some rides whilst questing and farming together, then turn this on. When in a party and you summon your mount, your taxi mount will arrive. Where do we go?
- __How to call ...__ - Say it! When your taxi arrives this short line of text will be chatted, so your friend will hop on and not let you wait. (Only if in group)
- __Service!__ - When your durability is lower than this and you look like Hogger's prey, give a big hand for your repair mount to appear.

### Account wide


Via checkboxes you can decide between the following:

- __Parachute mode__ - Always dismount anyway, no matter how high you fly and deep the fall. If disabled __Mounty #TLV__ will keep you safe on your mount whilst flying.
- __Auto open mode__ - The option frame will open and close automatically with the mount journal.
- __Debug mode__ - Magic in numbers and letters. See for yourself what __Mounty #TLV__ let's you know via chat messages.

### Profiles

You can use different profiles like in many other addons.

Also you can switch between _account wide profiles_ or _individual profiles for each character_. And you can even copy profiles from global to individual and vice versa. Safety first: profiles will never be deleted nor overwritten but renamed if already existent.

Also there is a new button in the mount journal to open __Mounty #TLV__. This can be positioned or be hidden by a slider.

## Binding keys

__Use _system key bindings_ to assign your magic key.__

Besides the _magic key_ you can also bind some _special keys_ to summon a mount of a category of your choice. No magic then, but pure free will.

For example, my config is like this:

- \# -> _Magic key_
- CTRL-# -> _Repair mount_
- SHIFT-# -> _Taxi mount_
- ALT-# -> _Water mount_
- CTRL-ALT-# -> _Ground mount_
- CTRL-Space -> _Show off mount_
